# Oberon-2 / Oxford Oberon Compiler bindings to raylib

This is a small project to provide usable multimedia and GUI capabilites to 
Oberon-2 programs compiled by the Oxford Oberon Compiler (OBC).

For this, a subset of popular libraries `raylib`, `raymath` and `raygui` is
to be bound using the OBC's own FFI and bespoke C wrappers where necessary.
